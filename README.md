# Reduced_Row_Echelon_Calculator
- This calculator makes any matrix of dimensions n by n+1 into reduced row echelon form.
- Reduced row echelon form is very useful for solving large systems of equations.
- I used Gauss-Jordan elinination to make this calculator.
- Uses NumPy; custom matrix
- Also uses argparse, in which you can input all the entries in the command line as so:
  * `-rownum r -colnum c -values a b c d e f g h i`
- Includes step by step instructions
- I have a Java version as well without any matrix library
- Created by Hamza Patwa (11th grade)
- Happy reduced row echeloning!
